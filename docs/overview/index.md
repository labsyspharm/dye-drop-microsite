# Deep Dye drop

We have developed a set of computational routines for designing and performing drug dose-response assays using the Dye Drop method. These routines are integrated with scripts we
previously developed for computing GR metrics in a single tool box.

The figure below summarizes our experimental and computational pipelines.
