Dye Drop Experimental Protocol
{: .fs-8}
{: .fw-400}
{: .text-blue-200}

Dye drop methods use a sequence of solutions each made slightly denser than the last by addition of iodixanol (OptiPrep<sup>TM</sup>), an inert liquid used in radiology. Denser solutions displace the previous solution with high efficiency and minimal mixing. This effectively eliminates the need for mix and wash steps, where most of the uneven cell loss occurs.

*On this page, we give an overview of the dye drop and deep dye drop protocols.* **For more detailed protocols used to generate our published results, please visit [protocols.io page](https://www.protocols.io/view/deep-dye-drop-protocol-j8nlkeww5l5r/v1){:target="_blank"}.**

## Dye Drop

**Step 1: Start with adherent cells in growth medium**

**Step 2: Stain**

Using a multi-channel pipette, gently add Hoechst+LIVE/DEAD Far Red Fluorescent dye (LDR) in 10% OptiPrep<sup>TM</sup> in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) along the wall of the wells. 

<span style="color:#F20D0A">Only dead cells are stained by LDR.</span>

**Step 3: Fix**

Add 4% formaldehyde in 20% OptiPrep<sup>TM</sup> in PBS along the wall of the wells. This solution will displace the stain solution at the bottom of the well.

**Step 4: Aspirate**

Remove the solutions in the wells, leaving some formaldehyde at the bottom to minimize cell loss. Refill the wells with PBS, seal the plates.

**Step 5: Image or Store**

Image plates immediately or store fixed cells in PBS at 4&deg;C up to several weeks.

## Deep Dye Drop

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/dye_drop/ddd_exp_overview.png" alt="Deep dye drop experiment overview" /></p>

**Step 1: Start with adherent cells in growth medium**

**Step 2: LDR + EdU Stain**
    
Using a multi-channel pipette, gently add LIVE/DEAD Far Red FLuorescent dye (LDR) and EdU (5-ethylnyl-2'-deoxyuridine) in 10% OptiPrep<sup>TM</sup> in PBS solution along the wall of the wells.

<span style="color:#F20D0A">Only dead cells are stained by LDR.</span>

**Steps 3-5: Same as Dye Drop**
    
Store in PBS at the end of Step 5

**Step 6: Permeabilize**

Add 0.5% Triton X-100 in 10% OptiPrep<sup>TM</sup> to permeabilize cell membranes. 

**Step 7: Click Label EdU**

Label EdU with a fluorescent dye azide via Click chemistry in 20% OptiPrep<sup>TM</sup>

<span style="color:#46C7FC">Only S-phase cells are stained by fluorescently-labeled EdU.</span>

**Step 8: Aspirate**

Remove solutions from the wells via gentle aspiration.

**Step 9: Block**

Add blocking solution.

**Step 10: pH3 Antibody**

Stain with a conjugated antibody against phospho-histone H3 (pH3) in 10% OptiPrep<sup>TM</sup>

<span style="color:#0FF169">Only M-phase cells are stained by the pH3 antibody.</span>
