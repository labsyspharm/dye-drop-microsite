## This website contains different types of documentation


1. [Overview](./overview/) provides relevant background information on the dye drop experimental and computational methods, and the associated growth rate metrics.

2. The [experimental protocol](./protocol.html) page provides details for performing the dye drop wet-lab experiment.

3. The [computational tutorial](./tutorial.html)\* outlines a step-by-step example workflow that allows beginners to process an example data set computationally with deep dye drop.

4. [Parameter reference](./parameters.html) provides detailed documentation on how to use dye drop to extract cell cycle information
