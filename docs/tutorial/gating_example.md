# An example of running the automated gating script

1. Install the package as explained in the [Installation](/dye_drop/Installation.html) page.
2. The example directory (located in `DrugResponse/python/cell_cycle_gating/examples/`) contains a Raw data folder `EX_01[78956]`.
3. This folder contains 10 .txt files, each corresponding to single cell data from a given well (wells C3 to C12).
4. The example script below will read the contents of the folder, perform automate gating and output a .csv file that contains a well level summary of number of live/dead cells and fraction of cells in diferent phases of the cell cycle.
5. In addition, a pdf file containing figures that show the gating per well is available for review.
6. The example can either be run in a Jupyter notebook or in your preferred python session.
7. This example dataset contains 10 wells and should run within a minute. An entire plate with ~300 wells is expected to run in 10-15 minutes.

## Running the example

1. Import required dependencies
```
import pandas as pd     
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
from cell_cycle_gating import run_cell_cycle_gating as rccg. # The main functions for automated gating are imported
```
2. Import the metadata file that containg mapping between the well name and conditions (i.e cell line, drug, concentration etc). A metadata file in not required for succesfully running the script but is highly recommended.
```
# Load metadata file (OPTIONAL)
dfm = pd.read_csv('EX_01_metadata.csv')
```
3. Specify the name of the folder containing the object level data. Note: If your data is saved in a single file, provide the name  of the file (or entire path).
```
obj = 'EX_01[78956]'. # name of  folder containing example data
```
4. The column names in your input dataset may vary based on your software or personal preferences. However, the script expects a set of standard column names for DNA content, LDR, EDU features. Map column names in the input data to the standard names expected by the script.
```
# Name of object level directory
obj = 'EX_01[78956]'
# Load metadata file (OPTIONAL)
dfm = pd.read_csv('EX_01_metadata.csv')
```
5. Map user defined channel names to standarized names required by the script.
```
ndict = {'Nuclei Selected - EdUINT': 'edu',
        'Nuclei Selected - DNAcontent': 'dna',
        'Nuclei Selected - LDRTXT SER Spot 8 px' : 'ldrint',
        'Nuclei Selected - pH3INT': 'ph3'}
``` 
6. Run automated gating on the example dataset. (Run time ~1 minute)
```
dfs = rccg.run(obj, ndict, dfm). # dfs is data frame that will be returned containing well level summary of live/dead and fraction of cells in S, G1, G2 M, etc
```
7. Two files `EX_01[78956].csv` and `EX_01[78956].pdf` will be saved in your local directory.
